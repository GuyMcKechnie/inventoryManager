    INFO: General information about the application's operation. Should be enabled in production.

    WARN: Indicates a potential problem or unexpected situation that doesn't necessarily cause an error. Important to monitor in production.

    ERROR: Indicates an error that has occurred. Should be logged and investigated in production.

    FATAL: Indicates a severe error that may cause the application to terminate.
